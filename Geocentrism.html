        <h1>What is Geocentrism?</h1>
    <p>Geocentrism is an outdated cosmological model where the Earth is considered the center of the universe,<br>
        and the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars revolve around it

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <ul>
         <li>Ancient Greek origins: Early Greek thinkers like Plato and Aristotle established<br>
            geocentric models, which were based on the obvious observation that the Sun, Moon, and stars<br>
            appeared to move across the sky,orbiting a stationary Earth. They also believed that<br>
            celestial objects had to move in perfect, uniform circular motions.</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ptolemaic system</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>The geocentric model was most thoroughly developed by Claudius Ptolemaeus in the 2nd century CE,<br>
            in his work known as the Almagest. To account for the complex, non-uniform motions of the planets<br>(like their retrograde motion),
            Ptolemy used a complex system of epicycles and deferents,<br>which are circles upon circles,to accurately predict the positions of celestial bodies.</li>
        </ul>
